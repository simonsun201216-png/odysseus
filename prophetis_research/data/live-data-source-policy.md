# Live Data Source Policy

This file defines the minimum source behavior for time-sensitive market
questions. It is a source and freshness gate, not a promise of background
monitoring or autonomous trading.

Use this gate when the user asks about:

- today, now, current, live, intraday, premarket, after-hours, latest move
- 是否崩盘 / 是否调整 / 今天怎么�?/ 现在还能不能�?
- market reaction to an event that is still trading
- price, index, yield, FX, commodity, VIX, options or volume conditions where
  same-day data changes the answer

## Core Rule

For live-use answers, do a fresh source check before making a market judgment.
Do not rely on model memory, old case notes or stale market data.

Minimum live chain:

```text
time-sensitive prompt -> market-date resolution -> live data gate -> source cross-check
-> quote_time or publish_time/as_of -> facts/inferences/judgment
-> stale_after/must_refresh_if
```

If fresh data is unavailable, say so and downgrade the answer to `needs_refresh`,
`source_gap` or `watch_only`.

Before source lookup, apply [time-policy.md](time-policy.md) Market-Date
Resolution: relative words like `today`, `now`, `今天` and `目前` are anchored
to the instrument's market timezone, not to the user's local calendar date. For
US equities, indexes and options, default to `America/New_York`; if the user is
in China/Singapore on June 12 while New York is still June 11, a US-market
"today" quote must use the June 11 US market session unless the user explicitly
asks for China-date reporting.

The same rule applies in reverse. If the user is in the US on June 11 while an
East Asian market is already on June 12, a China/Korea/Japan/HK/Taiwan market
"today" quote must use that local market session date, not the US local date.
Use `Asia/Shanghai`, `Asia/Seoul`, `Asia/Tokyo`, `Asia/Hong_Kong` or
`Asia/Taipei` according to `market_scope`.

## Source Stack

Prefer the narrowest available source stack for the object:

| object | preferred live sources | fallback sources | minimum cross-check |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| US major index / ETF | exchange or official index page; Google Finance; Yahoo Finance; Stooq; broker/provider connector if authorized | professional media live blog with timestamp | two independent market-data sources, or one source plus a timestamped high-quality live article |
| single US equity | exchange/issuer trading page where available; Google Finance; Yahoo Finance quote; Nasdaq/NYSE page; authorized provider | professional media live article | quote source plus news/source explaining the event if the question asks "why" |
| non-US equity | local exchange/official quote page first; local disclosure/IR for events | Yahoo/Stooq/Google as delayed cross-check | local market source where practical; otherwise label as delayed/aggregated |
| rates / macro release | official release page or Treasury/FRED/Fed/BLS/BEA where applicable | professional media live coverage | official source for the released number; market source for reaction |
| crypto / FX / commodities | exchange/venue or reputable market-data provider | professional media live coverage | two venues/providers if the move is material |

For non-US markets, apply `data/market-default-packs.csv` first. Aggregated
quotes alone are enough for a quick delayed market read, not for a durable local
market conclusion.

## Required Fields

Every live or same-day market-pricing answer should state or carry internally:

- `research_object`
- `market_scope`
- `time_boundary`
- `user_local_datetime` when known
- `market_timezone`
- `market_session_date`
- `source_boundary`
- `quote_time` or `publish_time`
- `as_of_date`
- `source_names`
- `live_freshness_status`: `live`, `delayed`, `stale`, or `unavailable`
- `cross_check_status`: `passed`, `partial`, or `failed`
- `stale_after`
- `must_refresh_if`

For quick answers, the visible output can be compact, but it must still include
the time boundary and freshness caveat when the judgment depends on live data.

## Search Requirement

Search or live-source lookup is required when the answer uses any of these
freshness claims:

- "today", "currently", "right now", "latest", "premarket", "after-hours"
- same-session index/price/volatility direction
- market reaction to a newly published event
- whether a move is a pullback, correction, crash, squeeze, breakout or panic

For price, index, volatility, FX, commodity and other quote-bearing questions,
use `live_data_gate=required_quote_time`. For macro releases, regulatory
announcements, issuer news or other publication-only questions without a market
quote, use `live_data_gate=required_publish_time`.

When the question asks only for a stable definition, historical explanation or
methodology, this gate can be waived with `live_data_gate=waived_definition`.

## Evidence-Posture Mapping

Do not reuse evidence-log `freshness_status` for live-source acquisition
quality. The evidence-log field already has a separate schema:
`current`, `acceptable_for_period`, `preliminary`, `stale`, or `unknown`.

Use:

- `live_freshness_status` for live-source freshness in routing cards, source
  notes and quick-map outputs.
- evidence-log `freshness_status` for claim-level evidence posture after a row
  is logged.
- `cross_check_status` for whether live-source lookup was corroborated.
- evidence-log `conflict_status` for whether claim-level evidence rows conflict
  after evidence is logged.

## Classification Heuristics

Use explicit thresholds where possible, and state them:

- `normal_noise`: major index move less than about 1% and volatility calm.
- `pullback_or_adjustment`: major index down about 1-3%, or sector/index
  weakness with contained volatility and no broad liquidity stress.
- `sharp_selloff`: major index down about 3-5%, VIX or equivalent volatility
  rising sharply, breadth materially weak.
- `crash_or_panic`: major index down more than about 5% intraday or over a very
  short window, volatility in a stress regime, broad cross-asset or liquidity
  deterioration, and credible evidence of forced selling or systemic stress.

These are heuristics, not labels to force. If the object is a high-volatility
single stock, use object-specific history, beta and event context instead of
major-index thresholds.

## Failure Modes

Common live-data failures:

- source is delayed but not labeled as delayed
- quote time is missing or from a previous session
- the user's local date is treated as the market session date
- search result headline is current but underlying article is old
- one aggregator has a stale cached quote
- futures, ETF and cash index are mixed without naming the instrument
- premarket/after-hours move is treated as regular-session breadth
- price action is used to prove a fundamental conclusion
- a news headline explains correlation but not causality

If any of these affect the answer, downgrade the judgment and state the gap.

## Output Rules

For a live market quick map, include:

- core judgment
- fact snapshot with source/time
- inference separating price action from cause
- confidence and reversal condition
- `stale_after` or `must_refresh_if`

Do not give trade execution instructions. If the user asks about buying,
selling, adding, trimming, hedging or options, route through the actionability
and instrument gates after the live-data gate.
