## Intermediate Notes

### Market Structure

The move was not evenly distributed. Nasdaq materially underperformed S&P 500 and Dow, while reported semiconductor weakness was extreme. This points toward a high-duration/high-valuation risk-off move rather than a uniform selloff across all equity factors.

### Macro Trigger

BLS labor data gave the market a stronger labor-market signal than a near-term easing narrative wanted. Strong payrolls and upward revisions increase the odds that the market reprices rate expectations higher or pushes cuts further out.

### Rates

AP reported Treasury yields rose after the employment report. This is consistent with a discount-rate channel for growth-stock pressure. Direct Treasury or futures-source verification should be added before using this package for trade-level decisions.

### Events And Sentiment

Reuters-syndicated and Axios coverage both focus on chips/AI as the center of the pressure. Media causality should not be treated as proof, but it is useful for identifying where the market narrative concentrated.

## Fact Vs Inference

Facts:

- BLS reported May 2026 payrolls +172,000 and unemployment 4.3%.
- AP reported S&P 500 -2.6%, Nasdaq -4.2%, Dow -1.3%.
- AP reported yields rose after the jobs data.
- Axios reported Nvidia -6.2% and PHLX Semiconductor Index down more than 10%.

Inferences:

- Strong labor data likely triggered higher-rate repricing.
- Higher rates disproportionately pressured long-duration growth equities.
- Semiconductor and AI leadership amplified the broad-market decline through crowded positioning.

Judgments:

- The move is a sharp selloff / de-risking event, not ordinary noise.
- It is not yet a confirmed systemic crash because current evidence does not establish cross-asset liquidity stress.
- Readiness remains working_view, not actionability-ready.

## Claim Classification Notes

- Market index moves are logged as `market_pricing`, not fundamental evidence.
- Reuters-style causal framing is logged as `interpretation`, not fact.
- Prophetis's final classification is logged as L6 `interpretation` with upstream sources and monitor treatment.
- No position-size, add/trim, hedge, or trade instruction was produced because holdings and risk budget were not provided.

## Open Questions

1. Did credit spreads, funding markets, or bank equity stress confirm broader liquidity risk?
2. Was semiconductor weakness concentrated in a few mega-cap AI names or broad across equipment, memory, analog, and foundry exposure?
3. Did options positioning or ETF flows force the move, or was it discretionary de-risking?
4. Will Monday premarket price action confirm follow-through or show a relief bounce?

## Refresh Plan

- Refresh before 2026-06-08 US premarket if this is used for live decision support.
- Add direct market-data sources for QQQ, SPY, SMH/SOX, 10-year Treasury, VIX, HYG/LQD spreads, and sector breadth.
- If the user provides holdings, route next to position_review or portfolio_construction_review before giving actionability conclusions.
