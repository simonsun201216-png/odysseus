# Prophetis Routing JSON Examples

These examples show the machine-first routing contract. The `routing.json`
object is the canonical routing artifact; any user-visible routing card is a
depth-scaled rendering of that object, controlled by
[../data/output-surface-matrix.md](../data/output-surface-matrix.md).

`scripts/validate_repo.py` validates every JSON block in this file against
[../schemas/routing.schema.json](../schemas/routing.schema.json). Keep examples
small, schema-valid and behaviorally meaningful.

## 1. Quick Map Surface

Prompt: `Prophetis, 看一�?AAPL 方向就行`
