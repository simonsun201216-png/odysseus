# Long-Term Methodology Review

- task_mode: methodology_review
- research_object: long-term analysis methodology
- market_scope: public equity research across US, HK and A-share contexts unless a case narrows scope
- time_boundary: gt_1y, usually 3-5 year thesis formation and refresh
- research_cutoff_date: 2026-05-30

- primary_skill_or_loop: loops/methodology-research-loop.md
- routing_basis: user asked to optimize Prophetis's long-term analysis method and explicitly approved external deep research before workflow design
- routing_mismatch_risk: source scan may overrepresent public institutional frameworks and underrepresent private buyside execution details

## Provisional Conclusion

The best design is not five separate workflows for consumer, product, economy, industry and company analysis. Prophetis should use one integrated `long-term-thesis` workflow with mandatory conflict checks across five lenses:

- `consumer_demand`
- `product_reality`
- `macro_economy`
- `industry_structure`
- `company_execution`

The external scan supports adding a sixth mandatory bridge:

- `valuation_expectations`

This bridge asks what the current market price already implies about the five long-term lenses. Without it, the workflow may identify a good long-term business but fail as an investment research process.

## Candidate Architecture

1. Define the research object and horizon.
2. Select relevant long-term lenses.
3. Build a fact / inference / judgment table for each lens.
4. Identify lens conflicts and dependency order.
5. Translate the operating thesis into ROIC, growth, cash-flow, balance-sheet and capital-allocation variables.
6. Reverse-engineer what the current price appears to require.
7. Write evidence ladder, refresh triggers and falsification conditions.

## Source Quality Note

This review emphasizes institutional, first-principles and practitioner sources with public pages that can be revisited. It is not enough for adoption. The workflow should enter `trial` and be tested against historical and live cases before moving to `adopted`.

## Refresh Conditions

- stale_after: 2026-08-30
- must_refresh_if: a live case shows the lens map adds process cost without improving conclusion quality; external high-quality buyside process notes are found; or at least two long-term cases reveal a recurring missing lens.
