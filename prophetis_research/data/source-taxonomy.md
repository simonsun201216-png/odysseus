# Source Taxonomy

这个文件定义 Prophetis 如何�?data source 按研究用途分层。它不替�?
[source-schema.md](source-schema.md) �?[source-policy.md](source-policy.md)�?

- `source-schema.md` 定义 source record 字段�?
- `source-policy.md` 定义来源优先级和使用边界�?
- `source-taxonomy.md` 定义来源类别、可支持�?claim、禁止用途和刷新规则�?

正式研究中仍然必须把具体 source 写入 `source-registry.csv` �?case-local
source note，并把被使用的信息写�?canonical `evidence-log.csv`�?

When a source enters through a user file, public API call, authorized data
provider, portfolio export or retained derived dataset, first apply
[ingestion-layer.md](ingestion-layer.md). The ingestion artifact records
permission, storage, field mapping and refresh scope; the evidence log records
the claim-level use.

## Core Distinction

`source class` 不是可信度本身。高质量来源也可能只提供观点，低层级来源也可能提供有用线索。Mira 先判断来源类别，再判断具�?claim�?

1. 来源从哪里来�?
2. 这条信息是什�?claim�?
3. �?claim 能否支撑 durable conclusion�?
4. 什么时候必须刷新�?

## SEC Authority Note

SEC sources have two different roles:

- Specific issuer filings or filed exhibits from SEC Archives / Inline XBRL are `issuer_primary_disclosure` and can support `L1` company facts when the evidence row records CIK, accession number, form type, filing date, report period and section or exhibit.
- SEC `submissions`, `companyfacts` and `frames` endpoints are official regulatory datasets. They are usually `regulatory_and_exchange` with default `L2` authority in the source registry. Case rows using them must record taxonomy, tag, unit, period and frame when available.

Do not silently change authority level between registry and case evidence. If a case promotes or downgrades a specific SEC-derived claim, explain the reason in `notes`.

## Registry Classification

[source-class-map.csv](source-class-map.csv) maps every row in
`source-registry.csv` to one `source_class`. The map is intentionally separate
from the registry table so older source records keep their stable schema while
taxonomy review can evolve.

Rules:

- Every `source_id` in `source-registry.csv` must appear exactly once.
- Every mapped `source_class` must be listed in the `Source Classes` table.
- `review_status` should be `reviewed`, `needs_review`, or `deprecated`.
- If a source has mixed behavior, classify by its dominant approved use and put
  the caveat in `notes`.

## Usage Rules By Research Need

### Company Facts

Use `issuer_primary_disclosure` first. `aggregated_financial_data` can speed up screening, but durable financial facts must trace to filings, company releases or official exhibits when available.

### Expectations

Use `consensus_and_estimates` for market expectation baseline. If unavailable, write `source_gap` and avoid replacing consensus with price action, media tone or company guidance.

### Research Reports

Use `sellside_and_expert_research` for report framing, forecast assumptions,
variant perception, valuation methods, target-price decomposition and author
views. A report claim can enter the evidence log as `forecast`, `assumption`,
`interpretation` or `opinion`, but it does not become a verified company fact
unless cross-checked against a higher-weight source such as issuer disclosure,
regulatory data, official industry data, market data or a reproducible
calculation.

When a report is user-provided, paid, licensed, clipped, screenshot-only or
permission-unclear, first apply [ingestion-layer.md](ingestion-layer.md). Tracked
artifacts may include compliant metadata, short effect notes and claim-level
summaries, not raw restricted report content.

### Market Reaction

Use `market_price_and_trading` for price, volume, valuation and options-implied reaction. Treat it as `market_pricing`, not evidence that fundamentals improved or deteriorated.

For technical / market-pricing context, record price, volume, volatility, options, short interest and derived levels as `market_pricing` or `derived_calculation`. These claims can support setup quality, follow-through, trigger levels, invalidation and refresh priority, but they cannot by themselves support business execution, demand, margin or moat conclusions.

When the user asks about today, now, current market reaction, intraday direction
or whether a move is a pullback/crash/panic, first apply
[live-data-source-policy.md](live-data-source-policy.md). Live-use market
judgments require `quote_time` or `publish_time`, source freshness status and a
cross-check or explicit downgrade.

### Industry Context

Use `official_macro_and_industry`, `industry_and_supply_chain_signal`, `sellside_and_expert_research` and `professional_media` together. Single-source industry narratives should be downgraded unless confirmed by primary data or multiple independent sources.

### Early Alpha And Rumor Watch

Use `social_and_community_signal` only for discovery, monitoring and variant perception. The output must include:

- `verification_path`
- `what_would_confirm`
- `what_would_disconfirm`
- `next_refresh_trigger`

### Derived Work

Any `Prophetis_derived_analysis` source must list upstream sources. If the upstream source becomes stale, contradicted or unavailable, the derived conclusion becomes `needs_refresh`.

## Default Source Stack

For formal single-equity research, the default source stack is:

1. `issuer_primary_disclosure`
2. `market_price_and_trading`
3. `consensus_and_estimates` or explicit `source_gap`
4. `professional_media` or `industry_and_supply_chain_signal` for event context
5. `Prophetis_derived_analysis` with upstream links

For a monitoring update, the minimum source stack is:

1. source that triggered the update
2. existing thesis/evidence log
3. at least one confirming or disconfirming source where practical
4. market reaction source if the update is market-relevant

## Refresh Contract

Every case output using this taxonomy should include either:

- `stale_after`
- `must_refresh_if`
- or a case-specific refresh condition

Default stale rules:

- Company financial facts: next quarterly or annual report.
- Live market data: 30-60 minutes for intraday use unless the output states a
  stricter `stale_after`; same day for closing-session summaries.
- Market data: same day for live use; 30 days for background technical context.
- Event/news sources: 14 days unless confirmed by primary disclosure.
- Social and rumor signals: 24-72 hours for active monitoring; otherwise `watch_only`.
- Derived analysis: whenever any upstream source changes materially.

## Validation Questions

Before using a source for a durable conclusion, ask:

1. Is the source class appropriate for this claim?
2. Is the `claim_type` recorded separately from source quality?
3. Is there an `as_of_date` or `source_date`?
4. Is this source primary, secondary, signal or blocked for the specific conclusion?
5. What would refresh, weaken or invalidate the claim?
