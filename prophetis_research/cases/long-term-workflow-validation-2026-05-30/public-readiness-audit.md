- status: not_public_grade

## Requirement Audit

| requirement | current evidence | status | gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| External method scan | `cases/long-term-methodology-2026-05-30/`, `g01-external-method-source-audit.csv`, `g01-external-method-source-upgrade-2026-05-30.md`, `scripts/validate_g01_external_method_scan.py` | partial_pass_improved | Chinese/practitioner coverage improved with public Asian/Chinese practitioner sources, but private buyside execution detail remains undercovered and reviewer acceptance is required. |
| At least 4 live theme/company tests | ETN, VRT, CRM, LLY, humanoid robotics value-capture screen, nuclear/SMR/AI power screen, stablecoin/tokenized payment screen, defense autonomy screen plus direction-level four-theme scan | pass_internal_improved | Needs external independent reviewer dry run and public-ready source cleanup before external sharing. |
| Recent-theme refresh discipline | `trial-theme-matrix.csv`, `theme-selection-refresh-audit.csv`, `scripts/validate_recent_theme_selection.py`, `scripts/validate_trial_theme_matrix.py`, `scripts/validate_theme_selection_refresh_audit.py` | pass_internal | Theme selection now has source-linked freshness, stale_after and drop/replace controls; the composite validator is used by objective/goal audits, and the theme list still needs periodic refresh if market leadership changes. |
| Practice falsification discipline | `practice-falsification-audit.csv`, `scripts/validate_practice_falsification_audit.py` | pass_internal | Eight methodology claims now trace to 39 case links, explicit rejection tests, actionability/source-gap deltas and G04/G06 release boundaries; G06 must still challenge `practice_falsification` before external release. |
| Methodology iteration traceability | `methodology-iteration-trace-audit.csv`, `scripts/validate_methodology_iteration_trace_audit.py` | pass_internal | Twelve iterations now trace case failures to patch artifacts, validation commands, decision effects and G04/G06 release boundaries; G06 must still challenge whether the patches are sufficient and not overfit. |
| Multi-lens case coverage | `multi-lens-coverage-audit.csv`, `scripts/validate_multi_lens_coverage_audit.py` | pass_internal | Consumer, product, economy, industry, company and valuation lenses now map to 26 case links and 25 lens markers with actionability or stop-rule deltas; reviewer and colleague acceptance must still test usability. |
| At least 2 historical failure backtests | TDOC, PTON plus historical valuation reconstruction tables, near-peak EV bridge, transcript source upgrade, consensus source-attempt log and archive audit | partial_pass_source_cleanup_improved | Consensus reconstruction is now documented through source attempts and an unavailable-data exception, but external public-grade example use still needs reviewer acceptance or licensed export. |
| At least 1 follow-through refresh | LLY payer/access source-gap refresh | partial_pass_process_only | Useful refresh mechanics test, but not a true post-memo quarterly/product follow-through because it uses evidence inside the original cutoff window. |
| Evidence logs for durable conclusions | ETN, VRT, CRM, TDOC evidence logs | pass_internal | Some historical TDOC source pages need archival or SEC-filing backup before external sharing. |
| Valuation expectation discipline | ETN, VRT, CRM, LLY expectation maps plus expectation-map data availability audit, G05 upgrade and FY2 FCF source upgrade | pass_public_grade | CRM now has current valuation, FY1/FY2 revenue and EPS estimates, MarketScreener FY2 FCF forecast, historical EV/FCF and forward P/E; G06 still needs reviewer challenge of source definitions. |
| Product evidence discipline | CRM product ladder/monetization map; LLY product/regulatory/commercial dry run plus FDA/CVS/CMS source-gap refresh | partial_pass_improved | Need all-PBM confirmation, plan-level payer evidence and one contrast product case if external sharing. |
| Pull-forward demand discipline | TDOC and PTON pull-forward checks plus source cleanup | pass_internal_improved | Needs transcript-backed public examples and clearer dated checkpoint logic. |
| Reproducible templates | long-term expectation map, product monetization map, pull-forward check, hardware/subscription mix check, payer-access/net-price check, backlog quality, acquisition value-capture, cash-flow quality, power-contract/regulatory check, stablecoin reserve/regulatory check, government procurement/program check, source-gap refresh, public analyst checklist | partial_pass_reviewer_simulation | Candidate public fill guide exists and survived LLY, nuclear/AI power, stablecoin/payment and defense-autonomy dry runs plus internal reviewer simulation; still needs external independent reviewer dry run. |
| Institutional readability | `public-workflow-pack/` candidate pack, LLY fresh-case dry run, internal reviewer dry run | partial_pass_reviewer_simulation | Candidate workflow, fill guide and source appendix exist; still needs true follow-through refresh and external independent review before sharing. |
| Comparison against ordinary research | `ordinary-vs-workflow-comparison.md` and `.csv` | pass_internal | Internal comparison proves incremental actionability changes, but no external reviewer has replayed ordinary Prophetis memos. |
| Cross-case validation matrix | `cross-case-validation-matrix.csv`, `overlay-coverage-audit.csv`, `cross-case-validation-summary.md`, `scripts/validate_long_term_release.py` | pass_internal | Case-by-case failure modes and overlay coverage are now machine-checked; external reviewer still needs to challenge whether the matrix overstates evidence strength. |
| Historical backtest archive gate | `historical-backtest-source-archive-audit.csv`, `historical-backtest-publication-standard.md`, `historical-valuation-source-upgrade-2026-05-30.md`, `historical-transcript-source-upgrade-2026-05-30.md`, `historical-consensus-source-attempts.csv`, `historical-consensus-unavailable-data-exception-2026-05-30.md`, `scripts/validate_long_term_release.py` | partial_pass_source_cleanup_improved | TDOC/PTON now have filing-backed near-peak EV bridges, public transcript paths and consensus source-attempt logs, but remain internal evidence until reviewer accepts the exception or licensed consensus export is added. |
| External reviewer dry run readiness | `g06-external-review-handoff-2026-05-30.md`, `external-review-request.md`, `external-reviewer-brief.md`, `external-reviewer-scorecard.csv`, `external-review-results-template.md`, `external-review-intake-checklist.csv`, `blind-review-assignment.md`, `scripts/validate_external_review_packet.py` | ready_to_assign_not_completed | Reviewer request, packet, return template and intake criteria are prepared; packet validator confirms assignment materials match G06 return requirements, but no independent reviewer has completed them. |
| External reviewer return validation | `g06-external-review-return-validation-standard.md`, `scripts/validate_external_review_return.py` | ready_to_validate_future_return | Future reviewer returns now have a machine-checkable G06 acceptance script requiring assignment-tracker reviewer match, completed independence-screen return rows, G01 method-source, theme-selection freshness, practice-falsification, methodology-iteration traceability, G04 readiness/false-completion, G05 source and historical consensus exception decisions; no return has been received yet. |
| Follow-through refresh readiness | `follow-through-refresh-playbook.md`, `follow-through-trigger-tracker.csv`, `g04-follow-through-event-watch-calendar.csv`, `g04-later-event-candidate-screen.csv`, `g04-follow-through-execution-tracker.csv`, `g04-follow-through-handoff-2026-05-30.md`, `g04-follow-through-intake-checklist.csv`, `crm-g04-follow-through-assignment.md`, `templates/follow-through-refresh.md`, `scripts/validate_follow_through_trigger_tracker.py`, `scripts/validate_g04_event_watch_calendar.py`, `scripts/validate_g04_later_event_candidate_screen.py`, `scripts/validate_follow_through_execution_tracker.py`, `scripts/build_follow_through_packet.py`, `scripts/validate_follow_through_packet_matrix.py` | ready_to_execute_waiting_event | Refresh process, CRM assignment, trigger tracker validation, event-watch calendar validation, later-event candidate screening, execution-state validation with trigger/calendar/candidate cross-checks, default packet export dry-run and four-case packet matrix export audit are prepared, but no later material event has been refreshed yet. |
| Follow-through refresh validation | `g04-follow-through-refresh-validation-standard.md`, `scripts/validate_follow_through_refresh.py` | ready_to_validate_future_refresh | Future G04 refreshes now have a machine-checkable acceptance script; no qualifying later-event refresh has occurred yet. |
| Release gate tracking | `public-release-gate-tracker.csv`, `public-release-decision.md`, `public-handoff-manifest.md` | ready_internal_candidate | Release gates are explicit; external release remains blocked by true follow-through and external reviewer completion. |
| External reviewer bundle integrity | `external-reviewer-bundle-manifest.csv`, `g04-later-event-candidate-screen.csv`, `g06-reviewer-candidate-screen.csv`, `g06-reviewer-independence-screen.csv`, `g06-dispatch-readiness-checklist.csv`, `scripts/validate_long_term_release.py`, `scripts/validate_external_review_packet.py`, `scripts/build_external_review_packet.py`, `scripts/validate_external_review_dispatch_packet.py`, `scripts/validate_external_review_assignment_tracker.py`, `scripts/validate_g06_reviewer_candidate_screen.py`, `scripts/validate_g06_reviewer_independence_screen.py`, `scripts/validate_g06_dispatch_readiness.py` | pass_internal | Reviewer bundle now has required send/no-send manifest, G04 later-event candidate screen, historical consensus exception files, packet validation, assignment tracker / three-profile candidate-screen / independence-screen cross-checks, dry-run export control, temporary real-export dispatch audit and pre-assignment readiness checklist; actual external reviewer completion still missing. |
| Institutional colleague release package | `institutional-release-bundle-manifest.csv`, `institutional-colleague-release-notes-template.md`, `institutional-colleague-acceptance-memo-template.md`, `institutional-use-boundaries.md`, `institutional-adoption-faq.md`, `institutional-colleague-acceptance-checklist.csv`, `scripts/validate_institutional_release_bundle.py`, `scripts/validate_institutional_colleague_acceptance.py`, `scripts/validate_institutional_colleague_acceptance_return.py`, `scripts/validate_long_term_release.py` | ready_to_run_not_completed | Colleague-facing release materials, use boundaries, acceptance checklist and return validator are prepared and bundle controls pass, but they must not be used as final release until G04/G06, colleague acceptance and cutover checks clear. |
| Public release freshness | `public-workflow-pack/README.md`, `public-workflow-pack/operator-runbook.md`, `public-workflow-pack/source-appendix.md`, `public-workflow-pack/external-review-request.md`, `public-workflow-pack/external-reviewer-brief.md`, `public-release-decision.md`, `public-readiness-audit.md`, `release-qa-report-2026-05-30.md`, `scripts/validate_public_release_freshness.py` | pass_internal | Freshness validator confirms 15 public/reviewer-facing materials have concrete `stale_after` dates after 2026-05-30 and within a 45-day window, plus observable `must_refresh_if` triggers; 4 templates preserve refresh fields for future signed returns. |
| Final release cutover readiness | `final-release-cutover-checklist.csv`, `external-release-go-no-go-template.md`, `scripts/validate_long_term_release.py`, `scripts/validate_go_no_go_evidence_coverage.py`, `scripts/validate_final_release_cutover.py` | ready_to_run_not_completed | Cutover checklist and go/no-go memo template exist; evidence-coverage validator confirms 11 required gates map to 15 go/no-go evidence rows and cutover validator checks; standalone cutover validator reports `cutover_ready: false` with 13 pending rows and rejects treating the template, placeholder-filled dated memos or premature `decision: go` memos as signed release evidence. |
| Operational loop readiness | `loops/long-term-thesis-loop.md` plus `loops/analysis-routing.md` route | ready_internal_candidate | Formal loop is usable internally, but external release still depends on G04 true follow-through and G06 external reviewer. |
| Goal completion audit | `goal-completion-audit.csv`, `objective-readiness-audit.csv`, `scripts/validate_goal_completion_audit.py`, `scripts/validate_objective_readiness.py` | blocked_external | User objective is mapped to 10 proof components, including public release freshness; 7 are internally proved and 3 remain externally blocked by G04/G06/final release. Both validators also check the institutional packet dry-run's 40 required export paths before preserving `objective_complete: false` / `goal_complete: false`. |
| Release QA validation | `scripts/run_long_term_release_checks.py`, `scripts/validate_long_term_release.py`, `scripts/validate_public_workflow_pack.py`, `scripts/validate_recent_theme_selection.py`, `scripts/validate_theme_selection_refresh_audit.py`, `scripts/validate_public_release_freshness.py`, `scripts/validate_practice_falsification_audit.py`, `scripts/validate_methodology_iteration_trace_audit.py`, `scripts/validate_multi_lens_coverage_audit.py`, `scripts/validate_g01_external_method_scan.py`, `scripts/validate_g04_event_watch_calendar.py`, `scripts/validate_g04_later_event_candidate_screen.py`, `scripts/validate_release_verification_command_manifest.py`, `scripts/validate_external_release_action_queue.py`, `scripts/validate_g06_reviewer_selection_rubric.py`, `scripts/validate_go_no_go_evidence_coverage.py`, `scripts/validate_final_release_cutover.py`, `scripts/validate_institutional_colleague_acceptance.py`, `scripts/validate_objective_readiness.py`, `scripts/validate_goal_completion_audit.py`, `scripts/build_external_review_packet.py`, `scripts/validate_external_review_dispatch_packet.py`, `scripts/validate_g06_reviewer_candidate_screen.py`, `scripts/validate_g06_reviewer_independence_screen.py`, `scripts/validate_g06_dispatch_readiness.py`, `scripts/build_follow_through_packet.py`, `scripts/build_institutional_release_packet.py`, `scripts/validate_external_review_assignment_tracker.py`, `scripts/validate_follow_through_execution_tracker.py`, `scripts/validate_follow_through_packet_matrix.py`, `release-qa-report-2026-05-30.md`, `objective-readiness-audit.csv`, `goal-completion-audit.csv`, `release-verification-command-manifest.csv`, `external-release-action-queue.csv`, `g06-reviewer-selection-rubric.csv` | pass_internal | QA runner reports zero errors across release validation, expected external-ready failure, regression tests, recent-theme selection composite validation, recent-theme refresh audit, public release freshness validation, practice-falsification audit, methodology iteration trace audit, multi-lens coverage audit, public workflow pack overlay/source-trail/source-boundary validation, G01 external method-source scan validation, external reviewer packet validation, G06 assignment tracker validation, G06 reviewer candidate screen validation, G06 reviewer selection rubric validation, G06 reviewer independence screen validation, external reviewer packet export dry-run, G06 dispatch packet validation, G06 dispatch readiness validation, external action queue validation including future G04/G06 completion validator commands, G04 trigger tracker validation, G04 event-watch calendar validation, G04 later-event candidate screen validation, G04 execution tracker validation, G04 default packet export dry-run, four-case G04 packet matrix export audit, institutional release bundle validation, institutional colleague acceptance validation, expected institutional release packet export refusal, release verification command manifest validation, go/no-go evidence coverage validation, final release cutover validation, objective-readiness validation, goal-completion audit validation, ten case repo checks and twenty-eight CSV shape checks; this proves consistency, not external readiness or objective completion. |
| Validator regression tests | `scripts/test_long_term_release_validators.py` | pass_internal | Regression test proves release validator stays internal-candidate, external-ready check fails, blank templates are rejected, synthetic valid G04/G06 fixtures pass their validators, packet builders export expected bundles, G06 internal files are excluded, non-empty output directories are rejected, and current-state guardrails keep dispatch/cutover/objective/goal checks from being mistaken for completed external release evidence. |

## Current Verdict

The workflow is now meaningfully better than the initial theory. It has survived:

- infrastructure theme handoff
- diversified infrastructure single-company trial
- high-purity infrastructure contrast trial
- product-led AI software trial
- GLP-1 direct pharma dry run
- two historical failure backtests
- one humanoid robotics value-capture screen that correctly blocks premature single-stock actionability
- one nuclear/SMR/AI power value-capture screen that separates electricity-demand reality from contract/regulatory value capture
- one stablecoin/tokenized payment value-capture screen that separates adoption and regulatory clarity from reserve/regulatory equity economics
- one defense autonomy value-capture screen that separates policy urgency from funded program and delivery economics
- one ordinary-research versus workflow comparison showing case-level decision deltas

But it is not ready to share as institution-grade methodology.

Current release decision:

- `candidate_internal_release`
- `not_ready_external_release`

See:

- `public-release-decision.md`
- `public-release-gate-tracker.csv`
- `public-handoff-manifest.md`
- `../../loops/long-term-thesis-loop.md`

## Minimum Remaining Work

1. Add one true follow-through refresh after a new earnings/product event.
2. Run an external independent reviewer dry run of the candidate public workflow pack, including challenge of the G01 public-source sufficiency and MarketScreener FY2 FCF source.
3. Finish archived or stable source trails for historical backtests.
4. Get reviewer acceptance of the TDOC/PTON consensus unavailable-data exception or add licensed consensus export before using historical cases as public-grade external examples.

## Recommended Next Case

Run a true follow-through refresh on one live case, preferably `ETN`, `VRT` or `CRM` after the next material earnings/product update.

Reason:

- The workflow has enough initial live trials and two failure backtests to test whether refresh triggers actually work.
- Public-grade methodology requires a maintained thesis process, not only first-pass memos.

## Candidate Public Pack

Created:

- `public-workflow-pack/README.md`
- `public-workflow-pack/workflow.md`
- `public-workflow-pack/fill-guide.md`
- `public-workflow-pack/source-appendix.md`
- `public-workflow-pack/analyst-checklist.csv`
- `public-workflow-pack/template-inventory.md`

Status: internal candidate, not final external release.

## Operational Loop

Created:

- `../../loops/long-term-thesis-loop.md`

Status: internal candidate. This is the canonical operating loop for 3-5 year multi-lens thesis work, hot-theme-to-company handoffs and long-term valuation-expectation checks. It is not final external-release methodology until G04 and G06 are resolved. G05 is internally cleared but remains subject to G06 source challenge.

Remaining reviewer gate:

- A fresh analyst should be able to reproduce a case conclusion from the pack without reading the full internal trial notes.
- At least one true follow-through refresh should be added as an example before external release.

Internal reviewer dry run completed:

- `public-workflow-pack/reviewer-dry-run-2026-05-30.md`

Reviewer result:

- Found incomplete overlay/template coverage and outdated decision labels.
- Fixed README, fill guide, checklist and template inventory.
- This is still not an external independent analyst dry run.

Fresh-case dry run completed:

- `../lly-2026-05-glp1-workflow-dry-run/`

Dry-run result:

- The pack worked on a non-AI healthcare case.
- It exposed the need for `payer_access_and_net_price_check`.
- This is still not a substitute for an independent reviewer dry run.

Source-gap refresh completed:

- `../lly-2026-05-glp1-workflow-dry-run/source-gap-refresh-2026-05-30.md`

Refresh result:

- Closed the Foundayo FDA source gap with FDA approval and label evidence.
- Partially closed payer/access evidence with Lilly, CVS and CMS sources.
- Changed LLY from `watch_only_pending_payer_access_and_expectation_map_refresh` to `watch_only_pending_expectation_map_and_realized_price_refresh`.
- This still does not satisfy the full follow-through gate because it is not a later post-memo event.

Historical source cleanup completed:

- `historical-source-cleanup-2026-05-30.md`
- `../tdoc-2020-2022-failure-backtest/historical-valuation-reconstruction.csv`
- `../pton-2020-2022-failure-backtest/historical-valuation-reconstruction.csv`
- `historical-backtest-source-archive-audit.csv`
- `historical-backtest-publication-standard.md`
- `historical-valuation-source-upgrade-2026-05-30.md`
- `historical-transcript-source-upgrade-2026-05-30.md`
- `historical-consensus-source-attempts.csv`
- `historical-consensus-unavailable-data-exception-2026-05-30.md`

Cleanup result:

- Added source-backed peak-price / market-cap reconstruction for TDOC and PTON.
- Reduced historical valuation roughness and improved transcript support.
- Converted the remaining consensus gap into a source-attempt log plus reviewer-acceptance exception path.
- Reduced historical valuation roughness by adding near-peak EV bridges for TDOC and PTON.
- Improved transcript support for downgrade timing using public TDOC transcript paths and PTON company-IR-hosted transcript.

Humanoid robotics screen completed:

- `../humanoid-robotics-2026-05-value-capture-screen/`

Screen result:

- Routed the theme to `industry_map_first`.
- Confirmed that high narrative heat plus weak public-company purity should block single-stock actionability.
- Added `theme-value-capture-screen.csv` as a lightweight pre-case template.

Nuclear / SMR / AI power screen completed:

- `../nuclear-ai-power-2026-05-value-capture-screen/`

Screen result:

- Routed broad nuclear/SMR/AI power to `industry_map_first`.
- Confirmed that hyperscaler demand evidence is not the same as public-company value capture.
- Added `power-contract-regulatory-check.csv` as a triggered overlay for power, nuclear, SMR, utility and IPP cases.

Stablecoin / tokenized payment screen completed:

- `../stablecoin-payments-2026-05-value-capture-screen/`

Screen result:

- Routed broad stablecoin/tokenized payment to `industry_map_first_with_single_equity_candidates`.
- Confirmed that stablecoin circulation and regulatory clarity are not the same as equity value capture.
- Added `stablecoin-reserve-regulatory-check.csv` as a triggered overlay for stablecoin, tokenized cash, tokenized treasury and payment-network cases.

Defense autonomy / drones / counter-UAS screen completed:

- `../defense-autonomy-drones-2026-05-value-capture-screen/`

Screen result:

- Routed broad defense autonomy to `industry_map_first_with_single_equity_candidates`.
- Confirmed that DoD policy urgency is not the same as public-company equity value capture.
- Added `government-procurement-program-check.csv` as a triggered overlay for defense, government procurement, autonomy, counter-UAS and federally funded infrastructure cases.

Ordinary-vs-workflow comparison completed:

- `ordinary-vs-workflow-comparison.md`
- `ordinary-vs-workflow-comparison.csv`

Comparison result:

- Workflow changed actionability or downgrade timing in every completed validation case.
- This satisfies the internal comparison requirement but still needs external reviewer challenge.

Cross-case validation matrix completed:

- `cross-case-validation-matrix.csv`
- `overlay-coverage-audit.csv`
- `cross-case-validation-summary.md`

Matrix result:

- Every validation case now maps to an ordinary-research failure mode, workflow decision, reusable overlay/patch, public-release caveat and refresh trigger.
- Every triggered overlay now has a coverage row showing where it appears in the public pack and what gap remains.
- This improves institutional auditability but still does not replace G04 true follow-through or G06 external independent review.

Objective-readiness audit completed:

- `objective-readiness-audit.csv`
- `../../scripts/validate_objective_readiness.py`

Audit result:

- The original objective is mapped to 10 proof requirements.
- 7 requirements are internally met.
- 3 requirements remain blocking: G04 follow-through proof, G06 external independent review and final public-grade release.
- `objective_complete` remains false until those blocks clear.

Expectation-map data availability audit completed:

- `expectation-map-data-availability-audit.md`
- `expectation-map-data-availability-audit.csv`
- `g05-expectation-map-upgrade-2026-05-30.md`

Audit result:

- CRM is now the G05 public-grade candidate: FY2 FCF is sourced from MarketScreener, and historical EV/FCF / forward P/E are sourced from StockAnalysis ratio history.
- Added unavailable-data exception protocol to prevent substituting modeled values for consensus.
- This satisfies G05 for internal gate tracking, while G06 must still challenge source sufficiency.

External reviewer packet prepared:

- `public-workflow-pack/external-reviewer-brief.md`
- `public-workflow-pack/external-review-request.md`
- `public-workflow-pack/external-reviewer-scorecard.csv`
- `public-workflow-pack/blind-review-assignment.md`
- `public-workflow-pack/external-review-results-template.md`
- `public-workflow-pack/external-review-intake-checklist.csv`
- `g06-external-review-handoff-2026-05-30.md`
- `g06-external-review-return-validation-standard.md`
- `../../scripts/validate_external_review_return.py`

Packet result:

- The workflow pack is now ready to assign to an external reviewer.
- Reviewer return acceptance criteria are explicit.
- Completed reviewer returns can now be checked with a standalone validator.
- This does not count as completion of the external independent reviewer dry run.

Follow-through refresh packet prepared:

- `follow-through-refresh-playbook.md`
- `follow-through-trigger-tracker.csv`
- `g04-follow-through-handoff-2026-05-30.md`
- `g04-follow-through-intake-checklist.csv`
- `crm-g04-follow-through-assignment.md`
- `g04-follow-through-execution-tracker.csv`
- `../../templates/follow-through-refresh.md`
- `g04-follow-through-refresh-validation-standard.md`
- `../../scripts/validate_follow_through_refresh.py`
- `../../scripts/validate_follow_through_execution_tracker.py`

Packet result:

- Refresh triggers are centralized and executable.
- Execution state is machine-checked as ready and waiting for a later event, not completed.
- Preferred first refresh is `CRM_2026` after Q2 FY2027 materials.
- G04 clearing rule and intake checklist are explicit.
- Completed refreshes can now be checked with a standalone validator.
- This does not count as the true follow-through gate until a later event is actually refreshed.

Release gate tracker prepared:

- `public-release-gate-tracker.csv`
- `public-release-decision.md`
- `public-handoff-manifest.md`
- `external-reviewer-bundle-manifest.csv`
- `institutional-release-bundle-manifest.csv`
- `objective-readiness-audit.csv`
- `goal-completion-audit.csv`
- `final-release-cutover-checklist.csv`
- `external-release-go-no-go-template.md`
- `public-workflow-pack/operator-runbook.md`

Release result:

- Workflow can be used internally and sent for external review.
- It should not be externally released as final methodology until `G04` and `G06` are resolved.
- Reviewer bundle contents are now machine-checked for required send files and internal do-not-send files.
- Reviewer bundle export is now dry-run checked, dispatch-audited through a temporary real export from `send_to_reviewer=yes` rows and controlled by a pre-assignment dispatch checklist plus reviewer candidate screen.
- G01 external method-source coverage is now improved with public Asian/Chinese practitioner sources and a dedicated validator, but remains subject to G06 reviewer acceptance.
- G04 event-watch calendar now separates official-source monitoring from completed follow-through evidence; it has four watched live cases, one scheduled future event and zero later-event-available rows.
- G04 later-event candidate screening now separates no-event, scheduled-future-event and later-event-available states before any refresh can begin.
- G04 follow-through execution state and packet export are now checked across ETN_2026, VRT_2026, CRM_2026 and LLY_2026; the execution tracker cross-checks trigger tracker, event calendar and later-event candidate state; CRM_2026 remains the default highest-priority packet, and the packet matrix validator temporarily exports each live-case packet and verifies required control files, including later-event candidate controls, after a later material event.
- Final release cutover is now machine-checked against non-clear gates, checklist status and go/no-go memo evidence.
- Standalone cutover validation now distinguishes the go/no-go template from a dated signed memo and rejects placeholder-filled or premature `decision: go` memos.
- Institutional colleague final release packet export now refuses while `--require-external-ready` fails.
- Operator runbook is now included in the future release bundle and machine-checked for G04/G06/objective boundaries plus execution commands.
- Institutional colleague release notes, use boundaries and adoption FAQ are now prepared and machine-checked, including objective-completion boundaries, but remain future release materials until G04 and G06 clear.
